## Where? (absolute)

-   Everything happens somewhere

    -   We're here in King's Cross, Camden, London, England, \*Europe, Northern Hemisphere, Earth

## Where? (absolute)

-   How do we know *exactly* where?

## Where? Coordinate Reference Systems

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="60%"}
-   More reliable than names are coordinates

-   The earth is roughly spherical and points anywhere on its surface can be described using the World Geodetic System (WGS) - a geographic (spherical) coordinate system

-   Points can be referenced according to their position on a grid of latitudes (degrees north or south of the equator) and longitudes (degrees east or west of the Prime - Greenwich - meridian)

-   The last major revision of the World Geodetic System was in 1984 and WGS84 is still used today as the standard system for references places on the globe.

Where? Coordinate Reference Systems

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="50%"}
-   Projected Coordinate Reference Systems convert the 3D globe to a 2D plane and can do so in a huge variety of different ways

-   Most national mapping agencies have their own projected coordinate systems - in Britain the Ordnance Survey maintain the British National Grid which locates places according to 6-digit Easting and Northing coordinates
