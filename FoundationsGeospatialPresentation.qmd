## About Me

![](images/casa_logo.jpg){fig-align="right" width="74" height="100"}

-   Professor of Urban Analytics & Current Head of Department \@ Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), UCL

-   Geographer by background - ex-Secondary School Teacher - back in HE for 15+ years

-   Taught GIS / Spatial Data Science at postgrad level for last 10 years

## About this session

-   Whistle-stop tour of some of the key concepts relating to spatial data

-   An illustrative example analysing some spatial data in London - demonstrating the "spatial is special" idiom and how we might account for spatial factors in our analysis

-   All slides and examples are produced in RMarkdown using Quarto and R so everything can be forked and reproduced in your own time later - just go to the Github Repo link below

-   By the end I hope you'll all leave with a better introductorhy understanding of how we should pay attention to the influence of space in any analysis

## Where? Coordinate Reference Systems

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="60%"}
-   More reliable than names (that are rarely unique or reference fuzzy locations), are coordinates

-   The earth is roughly spherical and points anywhere on its surface can be described using the World Geodetic System (WGS) - a geographic (spherical) coordinate system

-   Points can be referenced according to their position on a grid of latitudes (degrees north or south of the equator) and longitudes (degrees east or west of the Prime - Greenwich - meridian)

-   The last major revision of the World Geodetic System was in 1984 and *WGS84* is still used today as the standard system for references places on the globe.

## Where? Coordinate Reference Systems

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="50%"}
-   Projected Coordinate Reference Systems convert the 3D globe to a 2D plane and can do so in a huge variety of different ways

-   Most national mapping agencies have their own projected coordinate systems - in Britain the Ordnance Survey maintain the British National Grid which locates places according to 6-digit Easting and Northing coordinates

-   Every coordinate system can be referenced by its EPSG code, e.g. WGS84 = 4326 or British National Grid = 27700 with mathematical transformations to convert between them

## Where? Describing and Locating Things with Coordinates

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="50%"}
-   Once we have a coordinate reference system we can locate objects accurately in space

-   Most objects that spatial data scientists are concerned with (apart from gridded representations, which we will ignore for now!) can be simplified to either a point, a line or a polygon in that space

-   Polygons and lines are just multiple point coordinates joined together!

## Where? Relative - Tobler's First Law of Geography

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="65%"}
"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."

![](images/image-914957276.png){width="2486"}

-   This observation underpins much of what spatial data scientists do

-   Being able to locate something in space, relative to something else, allows us to:

    -   explain why something may be occurring where it is

    -   make better predictions about nearby or further away things

-   Underpins the whole Geodeomographics (customer segmentation) industry!!

## Where? Relative - Defining 'near' and 'distant'

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="50%"}
-   Near and distant can mean different things in different contexts

    -   the furthest one would travel to buy a pint of milk is somewhat different to furthest one might be willing to commute for a job

-   In spatial data science one way of separating near from distant can simply be to define their topological relationship - Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) is the standard topological model used in GIS

-   Touching or overlapping objects = 'near'

## Where? Relative - Exploring Near and Distant

-   Near and distant in London
-   Map shows 2011 Census Wards in London, within Borough Boundaries
-   The Greater London Authority produced the London Ward Atlas - <https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas> - which collates a range of demographic and economic indicators for each of these zones in the city

## Where? Relative - Exploring Near and Distant

```{r}
coordsW <- coordinates(as(LondonWardsMerged, "Spatial"))  

col.knn <- knearneigh(coordsW, k=1)
plot(st_geometry(LondonWardsMerged), border="grey")
plot(knn2nb(col.knn), coordsW, add=TRUE, col="red", pch=".", cex=0.6)
title(main="K nearest neighbours, k = 1")
```

-   If we measure the distance from the centre (centroid) of one ward to another, then we might decide that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, kth. closest wards are near, the others are far

-   These neighbour relationships can be stored in an $n*n$ 'spatial weights' matrix

-   The `spdep` package in R

## Where? Relative - Exploring Near and Distant

```{r}
col.knn <- knearneigh(coordsW, k=3)
plot(st_geometry(LondonWardsMerged), border="grey")
plot(knn2nb(col.knn), coordsW, add=TRUE, col="red", pch=".", cex=0.6)
title(main="K nearest neighbours, k = 3")
```

-   We can then decide to include the "k" nearest neighbours or exclude the rest

## Where? Relative - Exploring Near and Distant

```{r}
LWard_nb <- poly2nb(as(LondonWardsMerged, "Spatial"))
LWard_knn <- knn2nb(col.knn, row.names = NULL, sym = FALSE)

plot(st_geometry(LondonWardsMerged), border="grey")
plot(LWard_nb, st_geometry(LondonWardsMerged), add=TRUE, col="red",pch=".", cex=0.6)

```

-   Other conceptions of *near* might include any contiguous ward with *distant* simply being those which are not contiguous

-   Near or distant could also be defined by some distance threshold

## Analysis of 'where'?

-   Where in London do students perform best and worst in their post-16 exams?

```{r}
tm_shape(LondonWardsMerged)+
  tm_polygons(
    "average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014",
    style="jenks",
    palette="Reds",
    midpoint=NA,
    alpha = 0.5,
    title="Avg GCSE Score 2014",
    border.alpha = 0)
```

Is there any pattern? Do better scores and worse scores appear to be clustered? How can we tell?

## Spatial Autocorrelation

-   Spatial Autocorrelation - phenomenon of near things being more similar than distant things.

    -   Do neighbouring wards have more similar GCSE points scores than distant wards?

-   Can test for spatial autocorrelation by comparing the GCSE Scores in any given ward with the GCSE scores in *neighbouring* wards (however we choose to define our neighbours - k-nearest, those that are contiguous etc.)

-   Average value of GCSE scores in the neighbouring wards is known as the ***spatial lag*** of GSCE scores

![](https://i.redd.it/muuhbvphzvp81.jpg)

## Spatial Autocorrelation

```{r}

Lward.lw <- nb2listw(LWard_nb, style="W")

LondonWardsMerged$z_gcse <- scale(LondonWardsMerged$average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014)

Vx <- lag.listw(nb2listw(LWard_nb, style="W"), LondonWardsMerged$average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014)

LondonWardsMerged$slag_gcse <- Vx

LondonWardsMerged$z_slag_gcse <- scale(LondonWardsMerged$slag_gcse)

coef(lm(slag_gcse ~ average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, data = LondonWardsMerged))

p <- ggplot(LondonWardsMerged, aes(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, slag_gcse))
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + xlab("Avg GCSE Score 2014") + ylab("Spatially lagged Avg GCSE Score 2014")

#coef(lm(z_slag_gcse ~ z_gcse, data = LondonWardsMerged))
#p1 <- ggplot(LondonWardsMerged, aes(z_gcse, z_slag_gcse))
#p1 + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

```

-   If there is a linear correlation between the variable and its spatial lag, we can observe that values in ***near*** places do tend to cluster

## Moran's I {.r-fit-text .column}

-   Moran's I is another name for the least-squares regression slope parameter
-   Values range from +1 (perfect spatial autocorrelation) to -1 (perfect dispersal) with values close to 0 indicating no relationship

```{r}
#mp <- moran.plot(LondonWardsMerged$average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, nb2listw(LWard_nb), pch=19)
#moran.plot(as.vector(scale(LondonWardsMerged$average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014)), nb2listw(LWard_nb), xlim=c(-2, 4), ylim=c(-2,4), pch=19)

#if (require(ggplot2, quietly=TRUE)) {
#  xname <- attr(mp, "ward_name")
#  ggplot(mp, aes(x=x, y=wx)) + geom_point(shape=1) + 
#    geom_smooth(formula=y ~ x, method="lm") + 
#    geom_hline(yintercept=mean(mp$wx), lty=2) + 
#    geom_vline(xintercept=mean(mp$x), lty=2) + theme_minimal() + 
#    geom_point(data=mp[mp$is_inf,], aes(x=x, y=wx), shape=9) +
#    xlab(xname) + ylab(paste0("Spatially lagged ", xname))
#}


#Reading in all schools basefile, and filtering out for the ones that are open, and in London
LondonSchools <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/pk56hu33liaog46/edubasealldata.csv?raw=1") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(str_detect(`EstablishmentStatus (name)`, "Open")) %>%  
  dplyr::filter(str_detect(`DistrictAdministrative (code)`, "^E09")) %>% 
  clean_names()

#Create a simplefeatures object out of the LondonSchools

LondonSchools_sf <- LondonSchools %>% 
  st_as_sf(., coords = c("easting", "northing")) %>% 
  st_set_crs(27700)
LondonSchools_sf <- LondonSchools_sf[LondonWardsMerged,]
LondonSecondarySch_sf <- LondonSchools_sf %>%
  filter(phase_of_education_code==4)

```

```{r echo = T}
moran.test(LondonWardsMerged$average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, nb2listw(LWard_nb))
```

## Moran's I

```{r}
tm_shape(LondonWardsMerged)+
  tm_polygons(
    "average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014",
    style="jenks",
    palette="Reds",
    midpoint=NA,
    alpha = 0.5,
    title="Avg GCSE Score 2014",
    border.alpha = 0)+
tm_shape(LondonSecondarySch_sf)+
  tm_dots(
    col = "establishment_type_group_name",
    title="School Type"
    )
```

-   Moran's I = 0.42

-   Moderate, positive spatial autocorrelation between average GCSE scores in London - some clustering of both low and high scores

-   Spatial Autocorrelation might be expected when distribution of schools overlaid and one realises that pupils from multiple neighbouring wards might attend the same school

## Explaining Spatial Patterns

-   Having observed some spatial patterns in school exam performance in London, we might next want to *explain* these patterns, perhaps using another variable measured for the same spatial units.

-   Our own experience might tell us that missing class could negatively impact our ability to learn things in that class

-   Hypothesis: ***wards where there are higher rates of absence from school might tend to experience lower average exam grades***

    ![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/students.png)

## Explaining Spatial Patterns

```{r echo=TRUE}
coef(lm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, data = LondonWardsMerged))
p2 <- ggplot(LondonWardsMerged, aes(x = unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, y = average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014))
p2 + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + xlab("% Unauthoried Absence Days 2013") + ylab("Avg GCSE Score 2014")
```

-   Taking the whole of London, it would appear that there is a moderately strong, negative relationship between missing school and exam performance

-   For every 1% of additional school days missed, we might expect a decrease of -41 points in GCSE score.

-   But does this relationship hold true across all wards in the city?

## Explaining Spatial Patterns

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="30%"}
-   Moran's I of GSCE scores means that we already know that the observations are probably not independent of each other (violating one assumption of regression)

-   Mapping the residual values from the regression model allows us to observe any spatial clustering in the errors

-   Clustering of residuals could also indicate a violation of the independence assumption of errors
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
model1 <- lm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, data = LondonWardsMerged)

LondonWardsMerged$model1_resids <- model1$residuals

moran.test(LondonWardsMerged$model1_resids, nb2listw(LWard_nb))

tm_shape(LondonWardsMerged)+
  tm_polygons(
    "model1_resids",
    style="jenks",
    palette="RdYlBu",
    midpoint=NA,
    alpha = 0.5,
    title="Residuals",
    border.alpha = 0)
```

## Dealing with Spatial Patterns - Spatial Regression Models (the spatial lag model)

```{r}
slag_gcse_model <- lagsarlm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, data = LondonWardsMerged, nb2listw(LWard_nb, style="W"), method = "eigen")

summary(slag_gcse_model)
```

-   One way of coping with spatial dependence in the dependent variable is to include the spatial lag of that variable as an independent explanatory variable

-   the `spatialreg` package in R allows us to easily incorporate a spatial lag of the dependent variable as an independent variable $\rho$ (Rho) in a standard linear regression model

-   Running the spatial lag model reveals that the spatial lag ***is*** statistically significant and has the effect of reducing the estimated impact of missing 1% of schools days from -42 points to -31 points.

## Dealing with Spatial Patterns - Spatial Non-Stationarity

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   One reason behind a clustering of residuals could be that the relationship between dependent and independent variables might not remain constant across space

    -   In some parts of London, it could be that as unauthorised absence from school rises, exam grades also rise (as unlikely as that might be!).

    -   Or, more plausibly, that in some parts of the city, absence has an even more pronounced negative effect than in others.

    -   It's also likely that the intercept values (the average value of GSCE rules, given no days of unauthorised absence) will be different in different parts of the city - some areas, on average, doing better than others

-   We can test for the presence of such phenomena by running a series of smaller, more localised regressions and comparing the coefficients that emerge

## Geographically Weighted Regression

::: columns

-   GWR is a method for systematically running a series of localised regression analyses across a study area, collecting coefficients and other diagnostics for an independent variable in each zone of interest.

-   Something similar can be achieved through spatial sub-setting - i.e. running analyses for groups of zones within a higher level geography

## Geographically Weighted Regression

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In a GWR analysis, kernel weighting functions of different bandwidths (diameters) and shapes are used to include and weight or exclude neighbouring observations

-   Adaptive weighting can be used to adjust the size of the kernel according to some threshold of observations

-   For every point in the dataset a regression is run including the values within the kernel (which, of course, can only be achieved effectively through understanding the coordinate reference system of the observations)

## Geographically Weighted Regression

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Plotting coefficient values for each ward reveals noticable non-stationarity in the relationship between absence and GSCE scores

-   In well-off central London boroughs (particularly Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea and Camden) we see evidence that absence is positively related to GCSE performance

-   In some of the outer-London boroughs (Barnet, Sutton, Richmond etc.) the effect of missing school is even more severe than it is elsewhere in the city

## Modifiable Areal Units and Ecological Fallacies

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Methods which accommodate space explicitly can help us better understand spatial phenomomena, but the arrangement of space can alter perceptions and the outcomes of analyses

-   The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) - popularised in the 1980s by Stan Openshaw - describes issues that relate to the shape, scale and aggregation of underlying phenomenon to artificial spatial units

-   Politicians have known about the issues of scale and aggregation for a long time and have used it to their advantage

-   The practice of Gerrymandering is widespread wherever there is a first-past-the-post electoral system and has been used to manipulate vote counts to influence election outcomes
